## Mere Friend Ki Yaadein Android Application
Mere Friend Ki Yaadein is an Android application developed using Java native languages. It provides a platform for creating and joining friendship groups to reminisce about precious memories. The application utilizes Firebase authentication (for admin auth), real-time database (admin & user details), and storage (for images).

## Features
<h3> Login Screen </h3>
Upon launching the app, the user is presented with a login screen. The login screen offers two options: "Admin of Group Sign In" and "Join Group." Additionally, there is a "Sign Up" option for new users to create an account.

<h3> Admin of Group </h3>
If an admin successfully signs up and signs in, they are directed to the home screen where various options are available. The admin can upload multiple images, provide a group description, create memories related to the friendship, and view details about friends and their own profiles. The admin also has the option to delete the group, which permanently removes access for all friends.

<h3> Join Group </h3>
Users who wish to join an existing group can navigate to the "Join Group" section. Here, they enter the admin's email address and their details. If the group exists, the user gains access to all the details uploaded by the admin. However, users do not have permission to modify any details, as only the admin can make changes.
